[How to Save Images For the Web](https://flothemes.com/flothemes-image-sizes/)

- making images look good
- making images load quickly
- making images easy for search engines to index

**Color format**
-- sRGB for web

**1. Start with high-quality images**
**2. Use the right file type: JPEG or PNG**

  **Photos: JPG**

  -- should be saved and uploaded as JPGs
  -- this file type can handle all of the colors in a photograph in a relatively small, efficient file size
  -- if you’re using a photograph with text over it

  **Graphics: PNG**

  -- especially those using large, flat areas of color, should be saved as PNGs
  -- most designs, infographics, images with lots of text in them, and logos
  -- PNGs are higher quality than JPEGs
  -- come with a larger file size, too
  -- support transparent backgrounds (which you’ll want if you’re using a logo
  -- recommended saving PNGs as “24 bit” format rather than “8 bit” (richer array of supported colors)


**3. Resize images to optimize page speed and appearance**

-- balance between size and resolution

  ### What is size anyway?

  **Optimal file size** 
  
  -- the number of bytes the file takes up on your computer
  -- can slow your website way down. A 15MB (megabyte) image is huge
  -- either image dimensions are too large or the resolution is too high

  - large images or full-screen background images should be no more than 1 MB
  - most other small web graphics can be 300 KB or less

  **Image size** 
  
  -- dimensions of your image in px
  -- height and width are measured in pixels
  -- typical 795×300 px

    - **full-screen background, hero, full screen slideshows, banner images**: recommended 2000px or 2400x1600px wide

    - **inside Content Images**
      also portrait, landscape images

          Horizontal – max width 1500px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized
          Vertical – max width 1000px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized

    - **slideshow galleries**: all the same HEIGHT recommended 1500px, regardless if they are horizontal or vertical
    - **blogpost images**: all the same WIDTH, recommended 1500px, regardless if they are horizontal or vertical
    - **featured images**:
      -- consistency
      -- same size
      -- same as inside content img
    
    - **masonry grid**: at least 1000px width all images

    

  **Resolution for web images**
  
  -- quality or density of an image, measured in dots per inch (dpi)
  -- most computer monitors display 72dpi or 92dpi
  -- “save for web” (low, web-friendly resolution)
  -- for retina devices, you need to double the image pixel density

  - always “Save for web”
  - 72dpi and 92dpi are web friendly


**4. Make images the same size and style**

-- consistency (size, filters)


**5. Name the image file correctly for SEO**

-- consistency
-- lowercase
-- 0-9
-- no punctuation, spaces
-- hyphens -yes, underscores _no


**6. Fill out captions and alternative text**

-- `alt=""` tags give search engines a basic idea of what each image is about
-- phrase that describes what the photo is showing, preferably with a targeted keyword
-- add a caption to your image (people read photo captions more than other website text)

-- don’t try to keyword
-- accurately describe an image in plain language
-- adding irrelevant or repetitive keywords will get you penalized by the search engine!


**7. Put the image near relevant text**

-- related to what the text is saying
-- image surrounded by relevant information (with related keywords) will rank better
